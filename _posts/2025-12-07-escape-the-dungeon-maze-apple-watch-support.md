Great news for Apple Watch users <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span>! The Apple Watch version of "Escape The Dungeon Maze" now has full feature parity with iOS!

## Extended UI Testing and Bug Fixes

I've extended my UI test suite to cover the Apple Watch version, which helped me detect and fix several major bugs that were affecting gameplay. This comprehensive testing ensures a smooth experience across all platforms.

## Full Feature Support

The Watch version now supports the same features as the iOS version and is fully playable! All the new additions from this update - potions, keys, chests, haunted states, and more - work perfectly on your wrist.

## Improved Touch Handling

I've also improved the touch handling for the smaller Watch screen by increasing the touch areas for:
- Locks and keys
- Game items
- Switches
- Doors
- And other interactive elements

This makes it much easier to interact with dungeon elements on the compact Watch display without accidental taps.

The December 2025 release is bringing "Escape The Dungeon Maze" to its best state yet across all Apple platforms!
