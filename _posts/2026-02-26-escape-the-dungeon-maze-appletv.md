Exciting news! I've finally resumed work on the **Apple TV port** of "The Dungeon - Get Out". <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.3 - End of March 2026</span>

I know the future of the Apple TV platform is somewhat unclear, but "The Dungeon - Get Out" was designed as a multi-platform app from the very beginning. The Apple TV version was always part of the vision - I just ran out of time to integrate the Game Controller SDK, and then Apple's transition from UIKit to SwiftUI put things on hold for a while.

Now everything is ready and development is moving forward. Hopefully it all goes smoothly and I can release the Apple TV version soon. And who knows - maybe Apple will surprise us with new Apple TV hardware in the future!

## Game Controller Support

Along with the Apple TV port, **Game Controller support will also be added to iOS**. This means iPhone and iPad players will be able to connect their favorite game controllers and enjoy a more immersive dungeon crawling experience on their devices too.

Stay tuned for more updates as the Apple TV port progresses. There's still plenty of dungeon crawling adventure ahead!
