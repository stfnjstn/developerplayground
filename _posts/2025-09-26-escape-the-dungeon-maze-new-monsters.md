I'm still working on a major update for my game "Escape The Dungeon Maze" and excited to share some progress with you!

I've added two new monster 3D models to the game: the **Tetrapod** and the **Pill** monsters. These new creatures will add more variety and challenge to the dungeon exploration experience.
