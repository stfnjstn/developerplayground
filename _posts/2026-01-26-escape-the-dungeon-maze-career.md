# What's New: Career Progression System

We're excited to introduce a comprehensive **Career Progression System** to EscapeTheMaze! Your heroes can now develop their skills and advance through multiple professions as they journey through the dungeons.

## New Features

### Four Distinct Professions

Each hero can now progress independently in four different professions:

- **Fighter** - Masters of combat and physical endurance
- **Hunter** - Experts in ranged attacks, agility, and precision
- **Priest** - Specialists in divine magic, healing, and support
- **Mage** - Wielders of powerful arcane spells

### Intelligent XP Attribution

The system now tracks **who** delivered the killing blow and **how**:

- **Melee attacks** → Fighter XP to the attacking hero
- **Mage spells** (fireball, lightning, etc.) → Mage XP to the caster
- **Priest spells** (healing, holy attacks) → Priest XP to the caster
- **Monster defeats** → Bonus XP awarded to the hero who landed the final blow

This means each hero develops based on their actual contributions to combat!

### Action-Based Skill Improvement

Every action improves related skills:

- **Cast spells** → Element magic skills increase (air, earth, fire, water)
- **Melee combat** → Small Fighter XP on each attack
- **Magic combat** → Small Mage/Priest XP on each spell cast
- **Monster kills** → Major XP bonus to the finishing hero

### Automatic Level-Ups with Visual Feedback

When a hero gains enough experience in a profession, they automatically level up with an on-screen notification showing their achievement!

**Each profession has unique benefits:**

#### Fighter Level-Up
- **+10 HP** - Increased survivability
- **+5 Stamina** - More endurance for combat
- **+5 Strength** - Greater melee damage

#### Hunter Level-Up
- **+10 HP** - Increased survivability
- **+5 Dexterity** - Better precision
- **+5 Speed** - Faster movement and reactions

#### Priest Level-Up
- **+10 Mana** - More divine power
- **+5 HP** - Modest health increase
- **+5 Faith** - Enhanced healing and holy magic

#### Mage Level-Up
- **+10 Mana** - Increased magical reserves
- **+5 HP** - Modest health increase
- **+5 Wizardry** - Greater spell power

### Progressive Difficulty

The XP required for each level increases progressively, making higher levels more challenging and rewarding to achieve. Your heroes will need to put in real effort to become legendary!

### Multi-Class Heroes

Heroes aren't restricted to a single profession! A hero could be a level 10 Fighter, level 5 Mage, level 8 Priest, and level 3 Hunter all at once. Each hero will naturally develop based on how you play them.

### Party vs Individual XP

The system intelligently distributes experience:

- **Combat XP** → Awarded to the individual hero who participated
- **Puzzle/Trigger XP** → Split equally among all living party members
- **Kill bonuses** → Awarded to the hero who landed the final blow
