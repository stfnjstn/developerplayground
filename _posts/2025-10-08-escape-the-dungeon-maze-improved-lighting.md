The development of "Escape The Dungeon Maze" continues with significant visual enhancements! I've been working hard on improving the 3D rendering quality to create a more immersive dungeon experience.

## Visual Improvements

The latest update brings three major rendering enhancements:
- **Shadows**: Adding depth and realism to the dungeon environment
- **Normal Maps**: Creating more detailed surface textures without additional geometry
- **Improved Lighting**: Enhanced illumination system for better atmosphere

Below you can see the dramatic difference these improvements make. Each comparison shows the old version on the left and the enhanced version on the right:

  <img src="/assets/2025/10/IMG1_New.jpg" alt="Scene 1 - After" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

  <img src="/assets/2025/10/IMG2_Old.jpg" alt="Scene 2 - Before" style="width: 48%;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/10/IMG2_New.jpg" alt="Scene 2 - After" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/10/IMG3_Old.jpg" alt="Scene 3 - Before" style="width: 48%;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/10/IMG3_New.jpg" alt="Scene 3 - After" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

*Note: These enhancements are available on iPhone and iPad versions. The Apple Watch version maintains optimized graphics for performance.*

Stay tuned - there are many more exciting features and improvements on the way!
