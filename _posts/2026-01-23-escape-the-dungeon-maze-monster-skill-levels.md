Development continues with the next update <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.1 - January 2026</span> for my game "The Dungeon - Get Out". It contains a new feature that will give level designers much more control over gameplay difficulty!

It introduces the new **monster skill level** attribute to the Level Editor. Now you can specify a skill level for each monster you place in your dungeon. Each skill level increases the monster's hitpoints and mana by 50%, making it significantly more powerful.

</div>

This makes it much easier to increase the challenge in later levels without having to create multiple different enemy types. Simply adjust the skill level, and your monsters become progressively tougher as players advance through the dungeon.

The Level Editor now provides greater flexibility in balancing gameplay and creating engaging difficulty curves. 

More updates are on the way, including additional editor enhancements and new gameplay mechanics. Stay tuned for more exciting features in the coming releases!
