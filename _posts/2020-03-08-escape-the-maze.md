I haven't blogged for a while, because I was busy with my new game project. Working title: "Escape The Maze"

Grown up with 16 Bit Home Computers like Atari ST & Amiga and being also fan of the demo scene, I wondered if it is possible to create a Dungeon Master clone on limited hardware like an  Apple Watch. The Game will also run on iPhones, iPads, Macs & Apple TVs. 

Surprisingly the biggest challenge was not the 3D Engine, but creating an usable user interface which works on all devices.

Why am I'm doing this?

I like the [answer from Petri Häkkinen](https://twitter.com/petrih3/status/1231093366655528960) about why he is developing a game for the Commodore VC 20. For me it is nearly the same: It means fun.

Not sure where this will lead. Maybe the game will be:

  * A [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master) clone
  * Something like [Midi Maze](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI_Maze)
  * A kind of [Pac Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pac-Man) from an ego shooter perspective
  * Something completely different



I will blog about the progress of my game and what I learned during the implementation phase. One of the next articles will be about UI test automation with XCUI and SceneKit.

That's all for the moment.

Cheers,  
Stefan
