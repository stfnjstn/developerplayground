I've added a new 3D model for "Flasks" to "Escape The Dungeon Maze"

## New Flask Model

This is laying the groundwork for exciting upcoming feature like porions

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">

</div>

Players will soon be able to discover, collect, and use various potions throughout their dungeon adventures. The flask models are just the beginning - the potion mechanics and effects are currently in development.

The massive update for "Escape The Dungeon Maze" continues to grow with new gameplay systems and content. More exciting announcements coming soon!
