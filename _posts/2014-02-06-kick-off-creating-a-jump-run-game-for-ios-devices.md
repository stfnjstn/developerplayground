## My new Game Development Blog

I love developing small games and did this on multiple platforms ...

... but no one has ever been really finished. The reasons have been every time the same: Not good enough, I didn't know how to distribute, no time to continue, ...

After buying my first iPhone and Mac I decided to learn Objective C. In my opinion the best way to learn new things is having fun. So I started writing a small game prototype. Without experience in Objective C and at the beginning not knowing where to go, I ended up with a running prototype and a lot of spaghetti code.

Now having a clear goal and a lot more experience on the iOS platform I decided to do a complete redesign.

To motivate me additionally I'll share the progress and my learnings in this blog.

Please be patient with me, if I need some time to post new updates. Being a father of two little girls means I have not more than one or two hours in the evening to work on this game (of course not every evening).

Let's see if I can finish it this time ;-)

Have fun!

Stefan
