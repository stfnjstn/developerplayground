Here are some features which are already implemented in my 1st person perspective dungeon crawler game running on iPhone, iPad, Macs, AppleTV and also on Apple Watch series 3 or newer. The game is developed in Swift and SceneKit. Instead of using a 3rd party game engine like Unreal or Unity, I've decided to implement my own, because my game should also run on an Apple Watch.

The Game itself is inspired by [Dungeon Master](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeon_Master_\(video_game\)) and [Legend of Grimrock](https://apps.apple.com/app/legend-of-grimrock/id965096605).

The video shows a subset of my automated UI test cases. I have published a short [tutorial about how to implement automated tests with SceneKit and XCUI](/xcui-tests-scenekit).Â 

Already implemented features:

  * Teleports
  * Pits
  * Rotators
  * Exits to next Level
  * Doors
  * Switches (Floor & Wall)
  * Monsters
  * Cure
  * Hidden ways

That's all for today.
