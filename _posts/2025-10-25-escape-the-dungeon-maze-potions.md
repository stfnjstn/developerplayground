The potion system <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span> has arrived in "Escape The Dungeon Maze"! Following the recent addition of flask models, I've now implemented the complete potion mechanics.

## Potion Types

The game now features a variety of potions with different effects:

**Permanent Potions:**
- Increase maximum hitpoints
- Boost stats permanently

**Temporary Potions:**
- Healing potions to restore health
- Buff effects with limited duration

These potions are available in both the Level Editor and the game, allowing dungeon creators to strategically place rewards and power-ups throughout their levels.

This potion system adds a new layer of strategic gameplay - players must decide when to use their precious healing items and which permanent upgrades to prioritize. The development continues with even more features and improvements planned for future updates!
