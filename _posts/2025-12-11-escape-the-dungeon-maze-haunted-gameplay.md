The Haunted States system <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span> fundamentally changes how combat works in "The Dungeon - Get Out"!

## Status Effects That Matter

Both monsters and your hero can be afflicted with powerful haunted states:

- **Poisoned**: Repeating damage over time that can quickly turn the tide of battle
- **Frozen**: Complete incapacitation - unable to move or attack
- **Frightened**: Terror prevents attacking, forcing defensive strategies

## Strategic Depth

The addition of haunt and cure spells, along with cure potions, creates interesting tactical choices:

- **Offensive Strategy**: Use haunt spells to disable dangerous enemies before they can attack
- **Defensive Planning**: Keep cure potions ready for when you get afflicted
- **Resource Management**: Balance using cure spells in combat vs. saving them for boss fights

This system rewards thoughtful play and adds a layer of complexity that makes every encounter feel more dynamic and engaging. You'll need to think ahead and plan your resource usage carefully!

The December 2025 release is bringing everything together - and the wait is almost over!
