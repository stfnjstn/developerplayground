The Level Editor also continues to expand, allowing you to create more complex custom dungeons on **Mac, iPhone, and iPad**. Whether you're designing intricate mazes on your Mac or making quick tweaks on your mobile device, the editor gives you the flexibility to build wherever inspiration strikes.

This release includes all the features we've been previewing over the past few weeks: monster skill levels, the skill potion system, and various gameplay improvements that enhance the overall dungeon-crawling experience.

But this is not the end! There are many more features planned for the future. Expect a new magic system, additional gameplay mechanics, enhanced editor capabilities, and much more with the next update. The adventure is just getting started!

Have fun with the new features, and thank you for playing my game!
