I'm continuing to work on update <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.1 - January 2026</span> for "The Dungeon - Get Out", and today I'm excited to reveal a brand new feature: the **Skill Potion System**!

This new system adds a strategic layer to the gameplay by introducing special potions that grant your character unique abilities and enhancements. Players will be able to discover and use different skill potions throughout their dungeon adventure, each providing distinct advantages in combat and exploration.

The skill potion system integrates seamlessly with the existing gameplay mechanics, giving players more tactical options when facing challenging enemies and navigating through dangerous dungeon levels. Whether you need a boost in combat or help solving environmental puzzles, these potions will be essential tools in your arsenal.

This is just one of many features coming in the next update. Expect more gameplay enhancements, new content, and improvements to both the game and the Level Editor.
