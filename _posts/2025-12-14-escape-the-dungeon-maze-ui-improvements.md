Polish and consistency matter <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span>! I've reworked several key dialogs in "Escape The Dungeon Maze" to create a more consistent and polished user interface.

## Dialog Redesign

I've migrated and optimized several important dialogs including:
- **Save Game Dialog**: Cleaner layout for managing your adventures
- **Hero Detail Dialog**: Better organized character information display

The goal was to create a more consistent UI experience throughout the game, making everything feel cohesive and professional.

## Before and After

Here's a look at the improvements:

**Hero Detail Dialog:**
<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/12/OldHeroDialog.png" alt="Old Hero Dialog" style="width: 48%;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/12/NewHeroDialog.png" alt="New Hero Dialog" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

**Save Game Dialog:**
<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/12/OldFileDialog.png" alt="Old File Dialog" style="width: 48%;">
  <img src="/assets/2025/12/NewFileDialog.png" alt="New File Dialog" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

These UI improvements might seem small, but they significantly enhance the overall player experience. With the December release just around the corner, every detail is being refined to make this the best version of "Escape The Dungeon Maze" yet!
