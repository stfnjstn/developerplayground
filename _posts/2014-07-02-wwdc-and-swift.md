### Welcome to Part 11 of my blog series about game development.

I've been busy the last weeks with watching WWDC videos. So much new stuff and so little time ;-).  My favorites are Swift, Playground, Sprite Kit enhancements like the new level editor and especially this new Interface Builder Feature: It is possible to use ONE Storyboard to target both: iPad and iPhone/iPod. Luckily Apple lifted the [NDA](http://oleb.net/blog/2014/06/apple-lifted-beta-nda/) a little bit, so it's allowed to talk about the new stuff. But step by step... First of all I'm planning to implement new parts of my game in SWIFT!

####

#### **What does this mean?**

One of the first things I've to figure out is how to call Objective C code from SWIFT and vice versa. I'll show this in one of my next posts.

#### **Why?**

Writing this Blog and implementing a game is one of my hobbies. I've no intention to earn money with it. Learning new things means fun for me. I just WANT to learn SWIFT. Maybe I would have taken a complete different decision in my job.

#### Where to start?

A good starting point to learn Swift is the official documentation from Apple. The iBooks version is available [here](https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/swift-programming-language/id881256329?mt=11). If you just want to have a quick start with SWIFT you can use this [Cheat Sheet](http://www.raywenderlich.com/73967/swift-cheat-sheet-and-quick-reference), provided by [Ray Wenderlich](http://www.raywenderlich.com/). You can also find some SWIFT tutorials on his website.

That's all for today. I want to complete the WWDC video about 'What's new in SpritKit'. In my next post I'll show how to combine SWIFT with Objective C.

Cheers,  
Stefan
