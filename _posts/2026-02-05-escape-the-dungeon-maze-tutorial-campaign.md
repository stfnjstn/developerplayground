I've been listening to your feedback! Work continues on the next update <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.2 - End of February 2026</span> for "Escape The Dungeon Maze" and the Level Editor, and I'm happy to announce a new feature that addresses one of the most common suggestions from reviews.

While I always tried to keep the user interface simple and self-explanatory, I agree that a short tutorial campaign could help new players get started more confidently. So here it is - a brand new **Tutorial Campaign**!

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">

</div>

## How It Works

Simply start the Tutorial from the main menu and play through a short guided tour. The tutorial introduces you to the basic mechanics, controls, and concepts of dungeon crawling before you venture into the real dungeons.

This makes it easier for newcomers to:
- Learn the basic controls and movement
- Understand combat mechanics
- Discover how items and inventory work
- Get familiar with doors, keys, and puzzle elements
- Feel confident before tackling challenging dungeons

Experienced players can skip the tutorial and jump straight into the action, but it's always there if you want a refresher or want to show the game to a friend.

Thank you to everyone who provided feedback - your suggestions help make the game better for everyone! More improvements and features are on the way as development continues.
