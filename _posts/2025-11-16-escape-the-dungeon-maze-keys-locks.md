I've introduced a new Key and Lock system <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span> coming to "The Dungeon - Get Out"!

## New 3D Models: Keys and Locks

The update includes brand new 3D models for keys and key locks, available in both the Level Editor and the game. What makes these special is that they leverage the tinting system we introduced earlier - meaning you can create multiple different colored keys and matching locks!

<div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; margin: 20px 0;">

  <img src="/assets/2025/11/TintableKeys2.PNG" alt="Multiple Key Colors 2" style="width: 48%;">
</div>

This opens up new possibilities for dungeon designers to create complex puzzles with color-coded keys, requiring players to find the right colored key for each lock. The tinting system means unlimited color variations from just one 3D model!

Work continues at full speed on the major update for "The Dungeon - Get Out" and the Level Editor, bringing together all these new systems and features. The December 2025 release is shaping up to be our biggest update yet!
