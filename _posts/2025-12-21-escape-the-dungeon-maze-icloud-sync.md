Your dungeon adventures now follow you everywhere <span style="background-color: #4CAF50; color: white; padding: 3px 8px; border-radius: 12px; font-size: 0.85em; margin-left: 5px;">R4.0 - December 2025</span>! I've enabled iCloud syncing for save games across all your Apple devices!

## Cross-Device Save Game Syncing

You can now seamlessly sync your save games through iCloud between:
- **iPhone**
- **iPad**
- **Apple Watch**

Start your adventure on iPhone during your commute, continue on iPad at home, and even play a quick level on your Apple Watch while waiting in line - your progress is always in sync!

</div>

## How It Works

Your save games automatically sync through iCloud when connected to the internet. Pick up exactly where you left off on any device - your character progress, inventory, dungeon state, and all achievements carry over seamlessly.

This is one of the final pieces for the December 2025 release! "Escape The Dungeon Maze" 3.0 is bringing massive improvements to gameplay, visuals, and now cross-device continuity. The wait is almost over!
