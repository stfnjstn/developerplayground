Hi, I'm Stefan …

… a software developer from Germany. I started programming more than 20 years ago and did this for multiple platforms, starting with classic computers like C64, Atari &amp; Amiga. Later I switched to enterprise development for Windows PCs or Windows Mobile PDAs in .NET. Currently I’m working for a software company, leading a small team which develops enterprise software for iOS, Android and Windows devices, based on web technologies. I still love developing software on my own. Therefore I started implementing little games for iOS in my free time. I would like to share some of my experiences in this Blog.
