For centuries, the Citadel of Shadows lay dormant—an ancient fortress towering over the land, shrouded in eternal darkness. Beneath its vast halls stretches a labyrinth of twisting corridors, forgotten chambers, and hidden passageways—an ever-shifting maze filled with peril.
Legends speak of a powerful Archmage who once ruled from the citadel, mastering forbidden magic that twisted reality itself. His downfall was sudden, his name erased from history. But now, the seals that bound his domain are weakening. Strange whispers creep into the minds of the kingdom’s rulers, and the land itself has begun to wither. A dark force stirs once more.
You are part of a band of heroes—mercenaries, scholars, exiles—each with their own reasons for venturing into the depths. Some seek riches, others knowledge, and some hunt for vengeance. But all must face the same peril: the shifting labyrinth beneath the citadel, filled with monstrous guardians, deadly traps, and the remnants of the Archmage’s experiments.
Yet brute strength alone will not save you. The dungeon is laced with ancient riddles, enchanted doors that demand answers, and illusions meant to deceive even the sharpest minds. Solve them, or be forever trapped in the depths.
The only way out is forward. Survive the maze, uncover the truth, and perhaps—just perhaps—escape with your life.
