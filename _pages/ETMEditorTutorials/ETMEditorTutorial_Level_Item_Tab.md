Game items such as keys, food, potions, weapons, and treasure bring your dungeon to life and provide essential gameplay elements for players to discover and collect.

## Item Positioning

You can choose between 5 different placement positions on a tile:

- **Center**: Places the item in the middle of the tile
- **Top Left**: Places the item in the upper left corner
- **Top Right**: Places the item in the upper right corner
- **Bottom Left**: Places the item in the lower left corner
- **Bottom Right**: Places the item in the lower right corner

Multiple items can be placed on the same tile, either at the same position or distributed across different positions.

## Add an Item

Items can be placed on various tile types including:
- **Closed pits**
- **Floor switches**
- **Deactivated teleports**
- **Empty tiles**
- **Alcovens**
- **Chests**

If you see a __+__ button when selecting a tile, that tile type supports item placement.

### Item Selection

When you click the __+__ button, the item selection dialog opens. At the top of the dialog, you'll find a filter bar that lets you filter items by category:
